## 📌 Introduction

Number Plate Detection is a computer vision-based project that automatically detects and recognizes vehicle license plates from images or live video streams. It can be applied in areas such as traffic surveillance, automated parking systems, toll gates, and law enforcement.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a lightweight, real-time number plate recognition system. The workflow involves:

- Capturing or uploading an image/video.
- Detecting the license plate area.
- Applying OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the number from the detected plate.
- Displaying or storing the result.

This project uses traditional image processing techniques and machine learning tools for optimal performance and accuracy.
